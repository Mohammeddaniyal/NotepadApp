# ✨ DaniPad - A Feature-Packed Notepad Alternative  

DaniPad is a **Notepad-inspired** text editor built from scratch. While it may not yet surpass Notepad, it is my personal project aimed at **creating something of my own**. DaniPad is continuously improving, and I plan to make it even better with **unique features**.
